To tell my thoughts on the last lecture is hard in my case because this isn’t my first doing a paper on it. But I think I will try to recap my thoughts on it one more time. The first thing I always think is his smile hides all his fear and sadness he also uses humor to raise the mood commonly throwing a joke to break the silence of the crowd. He also shows how invisible someone's pain may be because he shows that he is physically fit and feels fine even though he knows he has only months left to live. His examples are all practical and designed to give clear life advice such as you don’t want to always meet your heroes instead have your heroes meet you or “bring your heroes to you”. As well as he “shows trophies of your accomplishments” They don’t have to be physical but having something you can point to will show improvement or something that says you did what is required to earn it. And I think I will try to end this out with my favorite “Walls are a chance to see how bad you want some things” The obstacles are not barriers to you but barriers to others who want it less and all you have to do sometimes is sit back and take a moment to figure out a solution or a way around the wall. And yes you may find another wall on the other side but remember that that wall is not there for you but for others less-driven than you and all you have to do is try till you find the solution to get over the wall.
