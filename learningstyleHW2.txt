I think that with learning styles to really do something you must first figure out what yours is. Once you know this you can tailor it so you can learn the best you can. Also if you need to work in a group where everyone knows their own learning style we can build a program for work that all in the group. But without this knowledge of what you're good at you can stumble and fall. Take me for example I am a hands-on learner so I don’t do so hot in online settings but, I know that so I know to focus on the online class this semester so I don’t fall behind too badly. But someone who doesn't know this may see this as an easy class and end up doing it at the end of the week. And if they miss this due date then they can no longer accept late work and they just lost a week of assignments they can’t get back. So if you ask me I do think that our learning style does affect how we learn very much and how we learn must be known so educators can maybe plan for it and design a learning program for the students to learn the most they can.
